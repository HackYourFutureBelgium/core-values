# Code of Conduct 2019

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in our community to help us create a safe and positive experience for everyone.

Part of the HackYourFuture community are: students, mentors, external partners and staff. This is what we expect:

* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Remind yourself that it’s not you who decides what’s offensive, it’s the person/group who’s offended and we ask you to respect this.
* Before taking pictures of anyone in the community, seek for verbal approval.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert HackYourFuture staff if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our Sunday classes, in the online community, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of HackYourFuture.


Harassment includes offensive, harmful or prejudicial verbal/electronic comments related to gender, personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

In the case of unacceptable behavior by a member of the community we will seek a dialogue with all parties involved in the conflict, open or anonymously. If no consensus can be reached we reserve the right to expel members from our community who do not comply with the Code Of Conduct.

## If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify HackYourFuture staff or mentors as soon as possible.


## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify one of the HYF staff with a concise description of your grievance.

## Additional information for students:

* While being involved in our community, please abide by HYF’s core values:
  1. Be Proactive
  2. Show Commitment
  3. Contribute to the Community
  4. Be Kind
* (These four core values are discussed in more detail in [the Student Manual](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/student-handbook).)
* Put in all the effort required to keep up with the program (at least 30 hours of home study per week)
* Be sure not to miss any lessons. If for any reason you can’t attend a class, communicate with your mentor.
* Do your homework and submit it in time (deadline Friday evening 12 midnight).
* Do not copy homework, you want to develop your own coding skills.
* If you copy code, you need to cite your source through a comment with an explanation on the functionality of the copied code.
* If you receive feedback on your homework, reply to it and implement it.
* If you feel the class is going too fast and you are falling behind, let your mentor know as soon as possible. If you do not communicate in time, this will be seen as a lack of involvement from your side and therefore you might end up being expelled from HackYourFuture.
* In case you are on welfare and receive support from a client manager (contact persoon) at the gemeente (municipality) it is essential that you inform them about your participation in HackYourFuture. They should agree and support your decision to HackYourFuture and to start your career with an internship (which is often unpaid at first).
* HackYourFuture is a not-for-profit organization made possible by volunteers, corporate sponsors and recruiting fees. This means that we charge companies an education fee once you start working for them.
* If you find a job in the tech sector yourself , we expect you to keep the fees in mind and mention this to the company. Our fees are necessary to train the next generation of developers.
* If you start the HYF course, this means you are with us for the full duration of the course (approximately 7 months). We ask you to finish our program before starting an internship or job.


> HackYourFuture reserves the right to expel members from our community who do not comply with this Code Of Conduct.
